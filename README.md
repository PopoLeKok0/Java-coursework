# Java-coursework 🚀

Welcome to my repository for **university coursework**, where I showcase labs and assignments completed as part of my learning journey with **Java**. ☕️

## About 📘

This repository reflects my academic progress and highlights my coding proficiency and problem-solving skills using Java.

It contains:
- **Labs**: Hands-on programming tasks.
- **Assignments**: Larger projects integrating multiple concepts, including the implementation of an **X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe)** game.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

To run the code in this repository, you need:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed on your system.

## Assignment: X-O Game 🎮

In the assignments, We implemented a two-player **X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe)** game where users take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. 

Key features:
- Player vs. Player mode.
- Input validation to ensure proper moves.
- Winning condition check and game reset option.
